# MAX3010x Sensor Driver for ESP-IDF

This is a **C-based ESP-IDF driver** for the **Maxim Integrated MAX30105/MAX30102** optical sensors, adapted from the original [SparkFun MAX3010x Arduino Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_MAX3010x_Sensor_Library).

It supports reading photoplethysmographic data (red, IR, and green channels) via I2C, and is suitable for embedded applications like heart-rate monitoring, SpO2 tracking, and smoke detection‚Äîoptimized for use on ESP32 with the ESP-IDF framework.

## üì¶ Features

- Written in pure C for ESP-IDF  
- I2C communication  
- Works with MAX30102 and MAX30105 sensors  
- Initialization and configuration  
- FIFO data reading  
- LED power control and multi-LED mode configuration  
- Ported from the SparkFun Arduino Library

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Compatibility

| Sensor    | Red LED | IR LED | Green LED |
|-----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| MAX30102  | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ      | ‚ùå         |
| MAX30105  | ‚úÖ       | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ         |

This library uses **I2C**. Ensure you connect the sensor to the correct SDA and SCL pins and enable pull-ups (typically 4.7kŒ©).

## üß∞ Requirements

- ESP32 or ESP32-S series board  
- ESP-IDF v4.x or later  
- I2C driver enabled in `menuconfig`  
- MAX30102 or MAX30105 sensor module

## üì• Installation

Clone this repository inside your ESP-IDF project under the `components` folder:

```bash
cd your_project/components
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/esp-idf-max3010x.git
````

Then include the component in your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
set(EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS components/esp-idf-max3010x)
```

Or add to `idf_component_register` if inside a monolithic `CMakeLists.txt`.

---

## üß™ Example Usage

```c
#include "max3010x.h"

max3010x_config_t config = {
    .i2c_port = I2C_NUM_0,
    .sda_io_num = 21,
    .scl_io_num = 22,
    .i2c_frequency = 400000
};

if (max3010x_init(&config) == ESP_OK) {
    printf("MAX3010x initialized.\n");

    max3010x_sample_t sample;
    if (max3010x_read_fifo(&sample) == ESP_OK) {
        printf("Red: %lu IR: %lu Green: %lu\n",
               sample.red, sample.ir, sample.green);
    }
}
```
